Along time ago in the land of ice and snow known as Madison, Wisconsin, a group of brave wanna-be-developers hunkered in for the afternoon. Finding refuge in the toasty halls of the Computer Science building, they set to work. While writing line after line of professional code, an unexpected disturbance occurred. All four computer screens went black, then suddenly what showed up next shocked everyone present.
All of a sudden, everyone's screen simultaneously lit up with the words "Let's Play a Game". The students slowly turned to look at each other with fear in their eyes, then turned back to their screens. There was now a menu with two options, play or quit. Josh decided to click the quit button and vanished in front of everybody.
